                    <u>Food</u>
                </h3>
                <p>
                    All runners need to consume about <u>240-260 Calories per hour</u> when they 
                    run more than two hours. These Calories can come in just about any form: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>gel packets</li>
                        <li>hyrdration and electrolyte drink mixes</li>
                        <li>peanut butter and jelly sandwiches</li>
                        <li>McDonald's hamburgers</li>
                        <li>you get the idea...</li>
                    </ul>
                    What many runners struggle with is 
                    figuring out what to eat. Different foods work for different people because everyone has 
                    a different digestive system (see more on how to adapt your stomach in the 'How To Prepare' 
                    section). It comes down to trial and error. You have to try a lot of different foods to see 
                    what works for you!
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Energy Gels vs. Real Food
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Energy gels and chews (think GU, Spring Energy, Hammer Gel) and regular foods are two different ways to 
                    go about getting in Calories. You can also use some of both! The key is to find a combination 
                    that is <u>sustainable</u> (i.e. your body can handle it) for however long you are 
                    running.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Energy gels and chews are easier to eat and easier to digest. The carbohydrates can enter the blood 
                    stream in about 6-8 minutes whereas normal food takes about 15-30 minutes. However, energy gels 
                    and chews typically contain unnatural ingredients that don't agree with many runners' stomachs for a 
                    sustained period of time and are not as substantive as real food. While real food is harder to chew and 
                    swallow while on the trail, it is certainly a better option if it will help you avoid GI distress. 
                </p>
                
                <h3>
                    <u>Fluids & Electrolytes</u>
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The amount of fluids and electrolytes that a runner needs to consume is very individualized because 
                    different people sweat at different rates (see information on the sweat test in the 'Train Your 
                    Gut &amp; Sweat Test' section). The goal for all runers should be to <u>replace about 90-95% of lost 
                    fluids</u>. Runners should not replace 100% of lost fluids because there is water loss from water stored in fat 
                    and carbohydrate that does not need to be replaced. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Runners should be careful to not drink too much water to avoid hyponatremia, a condition which describes 
                    low blood sodium. Hyponatremia can be a life-threatening condition, and it is the primary motivation 
                    for electrolyte replacement. The primary electrolyte lost in sweat is sodium (the other electrolytes are 
                    not as important). Runners should make sure that they eat salty foods or take an electrolyte 
                    mix or supplement that replaces sodium lost in sweat. Again, different people lose different amounts of sweat. 
                    Saltier sweaters (people with salt stains on their clothing) should take in more sodium. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Runners should be cognizant that fluid and electrolyte needs will vary with varying conditions, especially changes 
                    in ambient temperature (see 'How the Body Works' section).

                </h3>
                <p>
                    The stomach is adaptable. Just like legs and lungs respond to workout stimuli, the stomach responds 
                    to digesting food in tough situations (i.e. while the body is moving). <u>Runners should place the same amount of
                    energy and focus into training their stomach as they do into training their bodies</u>. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Just as you run as fast or faster in training than you do on race day, you need to eat as much or more 
                    Calories per hour during training than you will need to on race day. This stimulus will get your body 
                    used to digesting an adequate amount of essential Calories while on the run. See the 'What You Need' section 
                    for food options.

                    <u>Sweat Test</u>
                </h3>
                <p>
                    All runners lose fluids and electrolytes in their sweat. Performing several sweat tests at 
                    different temperatures will inform you how much fluid to replace. Here's how to do it:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Weigh yourself nude right before a run.</li>
                        <li>Go do a one hour run at EnduranceRun (ultra race pace) intensity.</li>
                        <li>After the run, strip down, wipe down any sweat, and weigh yourself nude again.</li>
                        <li>Subtract your end weight from your beginning weight. Convert the weight to ounces (one pound equals 16 ounces or 1 pint of fluid). <u>This is your hourly sweat rate in those specific conditions</u>.</li>
                        <li>Aim to replace about 90-95% of those fluids (see 'What You Need' section on fluids for explanation)</li>
                        <li>Repeat the test in different conditions, ideally 10 degree Fahrenheit differences.</li>
                    </ol>
                    Figure out how much fluid you need. 10 or 20 degree increments. 1 hour. 16 oz = 1 pint of fluid.
                    only replace 90-95% of fluid because there is fluid loss in metabolic processes in body => food breakdown
                    non-functional water. hydration needs can vary throughout the race

                <p>
                    When concerned with nutrition, the body part most runners are concerned with is their stomach. 
                    However, it is important to understand how the body allocates precious resources to the stomach 
                    so it can digest food. The body has a fixed amount of blood and it must allocate the blood to 
                    different parts of the body:
                    <ul>
                        <li>brain (you need to be able to make decisions)</li>
                        <li>musculoskeletal system (you need to contract muscles to move down the trail)</li>
                        <li>surface of the skin (this is how you regulate body temperature - stay cool!)</li>
                        <li>stomach (digest food)</li>
                    </ul> 
                    The stomach is the last system that the body worries about giving blood to, and for good 
                    reason. Your body wants to make sure you survive: you need to think, move, and not 
                    overheat. Digesting food is not very important. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Runners must conduct a fine balancing act where the body does not allocate too much blood to 
                    any one area. That means you must keep your body cool, and not run faster than your fitness level.
                    The biggest challenge with this balance is that it changes with varying conditions. As the temperature 
                    rises, runners must take in more fluids and be more aware of their body temperature because they will 
                    sweat more and therefore lose more fluids (see 'How to Prepare' section on the sweat test). 
                    While ambient temperature is the primary game changer, the balance must be adjusted for 
                    varying intensity, altitude, humidity, and stress levels as well.

                    <u>Dealing with an upset stomach / GI distress</u>
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Most runners deal with an upset stomach at some point. How should you go about 
                    fixing this very frustrating problem?
                </p>
                <p>
                    First and foremost, <u>slow down AND cool off</u>. To get more blood to your 
                    stomach to digest food, you need to take it easy on other systems using blood 
                    (see 'How the Body Works' section). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are various home remedies that runners swear by. Some like a carbonated 
                    beverage like gingerale or Sprite. Others use Tums or other over-the-counter 
                    drugs to placate the stomach. You must be willing to try something. 
                    Be sure to consider how your change in nutrition 
                    at this point in time will affect other things. For example, if you stop eating 
                    for a significant amount of time so your stomach can feel better, you cannot move 
                    very quickly because your body will not have many Calories to burn. 
                </p>
                <h3>
                    <u>Bonking</u>
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The term 'bonking' means a strong lack of energy. This happens when the body does 
                    not have fuel to burn. Runners feel tired and lackluster, and sometimes even sleepy. 
                    To fix this common problem, <u>slow down and eat</u>! Your body needs more Calories to 
                    burn, so give it some. Energy gels and chews are helpful in this situation because 
                    they absorb into your bloodstream quickly and can get you perked up in about 10 minutes. 
                    If you don't have energy gels, eat whatever food you have. Just know that you need to slow 
                    your pace until your body has rebounded and has more energy to move faster. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    To prevent bonking, make sure you are eating enough Calories consistently (see 
                    'What You Need' section).
